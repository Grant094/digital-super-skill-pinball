# Digital Super-Skill Pinball
A digital version of the Super-Skill Pinball game by WizKids.

This game is made by [WizKids](https://wizkids.com/) and you can see more info about Super-Skill Pinball: 4-Cade [here]([url](https://wizkids.com/super-skill-pinball-4-cade/)https://wizkids.com/super-skill-pinball-4-cade/).

This digital version will only include Carniball and Cyberhack, as those pins are both available to print and play for free from https://wizkids.com/super-skill-pinball-4-cade/.

This app is in no way affiliated with WizKids or the Super-Skill Pinball brand.
